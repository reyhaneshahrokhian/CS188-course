# Project2

* ## Multi-Agent Search
* ### This project contains 5Questions:
   + #### Q1  : Reflex Agent
     * I have implemented the ReflexAgent in multiAgents.pyto play respectably.
   + #### Q2  : Minimax
     * I have implemented an adversarial search agent in the provided MinimaxAgent class stub in multiAgents.py. The minimax agent work with any number of ghosts
   + #### Q3  : Alpha-Beta Pruning
     * I have implemented a new agent that uses alpha-beta pruning to more efficiently explore the minimax tree, in AlphaBetaAgent.  
   + #### Q4  : Expectimax
     * I have implemented the ExpectimaxAgent, which is useful for modeling probabilistic behavior of agents who may make suboptimal choices.
   + #### Q5  : Evaluation Function
     * I have implemented a better evaluation function for pacman in the provided function betterEvaluationFunction.
