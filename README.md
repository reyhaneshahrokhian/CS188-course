# Project5

* ## Machine Learning
* ### This project contains 4Questions:
   + #### Q1  : Perceptron
     * In this part, I have implemented a binary perceptron with completation of the PerceptronModel class in models.py.
   + #### Q2  : Non-Linear Regression
     * I have completed the implementation of the RegressionModel class in models.py.
   + #### Q3  : Digit Classification
     * In this part training a network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset have been done by implementing the DigitClassificationModel class in models.py
   + #### Q4  : Language Identification
     *  Here, I had build a smaller neural network model that identifies language for one word at a time. the dataset consists of words in five languages. It has been done by Completing the implementation of the LanguageIDModel class.
