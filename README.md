* ## Search
* ### This project contains 8Questions:
   + #### Q1  : Depth First Search
     * I have implemented SearchAgent in searchAgents.py, which plans out a path through Pacman's world and then executes that path step-by-step.
   + #### Q2  : Breadth First Search
     * I have implemented the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm in the breadthFirstSearch function in search.py.
   + #### Q3  : Uniform Cost Search
     * I have implemented the uniform-cost graph search algorithm in the uniformCostSearch function in search.py. 
   + #### Q4  : A* Search
     * I have implemented A* graph search in the aStarSearch function in search.py. 
   + #### Q5  : Corners Problem: Representation
     * I have implemented the CornersProblem search problem in searchAgents.py. 
   + #### Q6  : Corners Problem: Heuristic
     * I have implemented  a non-trivial, consistent heuristic for the CornersProblem in cornersHeuristic.
   + #### Q7  : Eating All The Dots: Heuristic
     * I have implemented the foodHeuristic in searchAgents.py with a consistent heuristic for the FoodSearchProblem.
   + #### Q8  : Suboptimal Search
     * I have implemented the findPathToClosestDot function in searchAgents.py.
